Welcome to my space! :wave:

I'm Ramesh Gundluru, a Research Scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH), specializing in speech and audio processing, Machine learning and Deep learning. My research focuses on developing unified neural architectures for voice search, aiming to make human-machine interaction more natural and accessible.

I hold an M.Tech and Ph.D. (ongoing) in Electrical Engineering from IIT Hyderabad, with a strong academic record (CGPA > 8.5). My work spans a range of sponsored research projects in speech AI — including Keyword Spotting for 13 Indian languages under the National Language Translation Mission (NLTM) (sponsored by MeitY, Government of India), Robot Audition systems for DRDO, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) development for Indian English in collaboration with I’m Beside You, Japan..

I have published several papers at leading venues such as Interspeech, IEEE ASRU, GlobalSIP, and NCC, and have received the Best Paper Award (NCC 2023). My hands-on expertise includes PyTorch, Kaldi, TensorFlow, for speech — building end-to-end systems for keyword spotting, Automatic speech recognition, Speech synthesis and para linguistics of speech.

I am passionate about building intelligent, real-time, and multilingual speech systems, and I’m now seeking roles where I can contribute to speech AI research, applied audio intelligence, or voice-enabled technology development in cutting-edge organizations.
